## The Rise of DevOps

* Before 
    - To build a software company
    - set up cabinets and racks
    - load them up with servers, etc.
    - Set up "Devs" team, set up "Ops" team
    - Let them duke it out
* Now
    - There are AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
    - There are Chef, Puppet, Terraform, and Docker
    - Sysadmins write code
    - Devs and Ops write code, so DevOps is born    

* The goal of DevOps is to make software delivery vastly more efficient
